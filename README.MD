# Introduction

A simple implementation of boid flocking behaviors rendered with a simple GUI in Java.  It's provided for historical purposes only as an interesting project I worked on long ago.  There's a bunch of additional cruft in this directory and it probably won't build in it's current state.

I worked on this project between October 2005 and January 2006 around the time I was employed as an intern at IBM Canada.  There was a PDF in the folder titled "Roadmap-Based Flocking for Complex Environments" ([available online here](https://parasol.tamu.edu/publications/download.php?file_id=146)) that I must have used as a rough basis for the initial alorithms.
